        <h1>Things about Manali</h1>
        <p>Manali is a beautiful hill station nestled in the mountains of Himachal Pradesh, India. It is a popular tourist destination known for its picturesque landscapes, snow-capped mountains, and lush green valleys. I had the opportunity to visit Manali last summer, and it was an experience that left an indelible mark on my memory.<br><br>
        The journey to Manali was an adventure in itself. As we made our way through the winding mountain roads, I was captivated by the breathtaking views of the surrounding peaks and the gushing rivers that flowed alongside the road. The fresh mountain air and the cool breeze provided much-needed relief from the scorching heat of the plains.</p>

        <p>Jaipur became known as “The Pink City” when, in 1876, Maharaja Ram Singh had most of the buildings painted pink—the color of hospitality—in preparation for a visit by Britain's Queen Victoria.
